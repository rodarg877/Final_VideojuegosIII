IMPORTANT >>> Please Note:

I decided to provide this as I had a user that wanted to use the package in HDRP but everything was pink.
I zipped my folder, gave it to him and all worked on his side as well.
So this will save time to anyone that want to experiment with HDRP out the box.


This Village Exteriors 2019.X HDRP Materials forlder and it's contents is provided as experimantal.
I will update it when I get to it, but with Unity changing things on a regular basis some things might at times not be perfect.
Please let me know about any bugs or suggestions via email or Discord.
I have used the built in Unity Shader/Material converter tools.
I am an artist, so I have no clue how to code, so them breaking stuff is out of my control. 


How to use:
What I did was, convert the materials, then went and chose different shaders where Unity got the automated process wrong.
It is very simple. You back your current Material folder up and replace with this one.
Do not do it by overwriting, replace.
Delete the folder after backup, then paste this complete folder after unzipping it.


Feedback Please:
I have done basic tests by looking at a selection of prefabs with this new materials.
But if you do find something that I have missed, then please email me with a possible screenshot and prefabs root folder so that I can improve the included file.


Enjoy
